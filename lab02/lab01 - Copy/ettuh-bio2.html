    My name is Kodjo Ettuh, majoring in Information security and Network and cloud computing.
    I am interested in the cyber security field to help companies protect their sensible inforamtion and data against hackers.
    I am currently actively seeking an intership to get more hands on skills in the cyber security field. I am open to learn new things.
    During vacations, I love to travel and discover things. I love to watch football and soccer.
