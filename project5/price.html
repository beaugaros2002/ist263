    <h1>MoonWash Laundromat Price Target</h1>
    <p>
        MoonWash Laundromat has modern, eco-friendly machines, including washers and dryers from diverse brands. The modern washers and dryers look sleek and high-tech, washing clothes better than those used by other laundromats in the area. This includes machines that can use Alexa voice commands or communicate with functions within the appliance, eliminating the need to transfer loads from one machine to another. Some of the machines at MoonWash can deploy downloadable software fixes or offer remote access to allow you to control your washers with smartphones.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are a total of 20 commercial washers and 20 dryers in the facility, each with different load capacities. They use water heating systems and offer the use of biodegradable, fragrance-free detergents as an option.
